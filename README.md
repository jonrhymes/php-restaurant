# PHP Restaurant

## :battery: Link to live site:
[Franklin's Fine Dining](https://php-restaurant.herokuapp.com/)

## :trophy: Goals:
* A dynamic website that displays Home, Team Members, Menu and Contact pages. 
* PHP is used to split the entire HTML into two halves, templating global Header and Footer sections, so the rest of the content can be injected in-between.
* $_GET
  * Dishes, menu items, prices, team members and bios get dynamically displayed using an array via a query string `?item=club-sandwich`. 
* $_POST
  * Contact page contains form validation and handles submissions.
